### Fitness Data Analyser is a School Project. This code was taken in an unfinished state by my lecturer in order to practice on an already started project. Operations are described.

    importing the provided code from my lecturer to start its modification. 

* Edited the “welcome” print with adding “the newline character” that helps in formatting your code - start one line below, for better readability.

* Completed “calculate_bmi” function, by adding variable for the height, to convert in centimetres, then a calculation for body_mass_index(dmi).

* Completed “calculate_calories_burned” function, by adding a calculation for standard rate of calorie burn per minute to calculate calories burned for the user-specified workout time. For this to work, I added a variable with estimated burned calories per minute.

* Added counter in the end of the while loop in the Main program, to provide new input, with different message. Also aded additional statement for the user to decide whether user wants to continue with data for the next person or for the program to take him to the fitness statistics for the insured persons and the termination of the program.

* Modified the input text messages to improve experience.

* Fixed and completed the function filter_overweight_people as adding several weight categories in different functions, to specify the body type. Also modified the outputs to work with the new feature.

* Added different output (n\a) if a category is empty.

* Added Cover Photo, after editing it for the Project.
